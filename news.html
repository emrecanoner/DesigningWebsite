            <h3 class="main pt-2">NASA has flown its helicopter named Ingenuity for the first time on the Red Planet</h3>
            <p>
                This was the first controlled flight of a powered aircraft on another planet. According to
                preliminary data reaching NASA from Mars,
                the Ingenuity was in the air for less than a minute.
                This was the aim of the scientists. NASA aims to gradually increase the flight time
                and altitude of the helicopter in the coming days.
                The flight was originally scheduled for April 11, but was delayed due to a software error.
                The drone, which weighed about 1.8 kilograms, took off at 10:30 BST. It took a few hours
                for the data to reach the world.</p>
                <hr>
            <p>NASA warned that "the flight may not be successful". But scientists' worries did not come true.
                In the first flight attempt, the helicopter was planned to rise three meters from the ground
                and land after 30 seconds of flight. After analyzing the incoming data, NASA will also
                explain whether this plan is fully realized.
                Ingenuity was transported to Mars by Perseverance,
                the spacecraft that landed in Jezero Crater on February 18.
                The primary purpose of flight is to show that this technology can work on another planet.
                In reference to American aviators Orville and Wilbur Wright, who flew the first powered aircraft
                in 1903, NASA stated that the flight of the twin-engine helicopter would be
                "a Wright Brothers moment".

            <h3 class="main pt-2">Crypto money regulation: What does it mean to prohibit payments
                in digital currency, who will the bans affect?</h3>
            <p>
                The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) according to the new regulations, can not be served
                in payments for the use of assets from crypto April 30. There are both questions
                and reactions as to how the regulation will affect investors and the financial world.
                In the regulation, "Payment and electronic money institutions cannot mediate
                the platforms that offer trading, custody, transfer or issuance services for crypto
                assets or the fund transfers to be made from these platforms."    
                This means that some of the services provided by the intermediaries
                used by investors in cryptocurrency exchanges for money transfer cannot be used
                as of April 30. It is reported that the applications used for money transfer
                from crypto money exchanges will be affected by this regulation. Investors will
                need to make the money transfer more indirectly.</p>
                <hr>
            <p>
                Papara CEO Ahmed Karslı told A Para, "I am fundamentally against regulation.
                I think banning is the easiest method. It was more logical to discuss and
                talk with stakeholders and focus more creatively on solving problems," he said.
                Crypto currency trading platform Paribu stated that the regulation does
                not include crypto money exchanges and banks and said, "The regulation is only
                for payment and electronic money companies. Our users can continue their
                transactions in Paribu by making TL deposits and withdrawals through all banks."
