            <p>
                12 big clubs in Europe announced that they established the European Super League,
                which will consist of 20 teams, on Sunday night. UEFA, FIFA and the football
                federations of the countries reacted strongly to the decision. UEFA President
                Aleksander Ceferin said, "Players who will play in the European Super League
                will be banned from playing in the World Cup and the European Football Championship.</p>
                <hr>
            <p>
                Why did 12 clubs need ESL, what are they aiming with this organization?
                Why are federations opposing the league? What do the fans say?
                We have compiled the discussions about the European Super League.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4 style="font-size: 18px;">Which are the 12 teams?</h4>
            <p>
                The founding 12 teams are Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City,
                Manchester United and Tottenham from the English Premier League;
                Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid from Spanish La Liga; AC Milan,
                Inter Milan and Juventus from Italy Seria A..
            </p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 18px;">Will 12 teams leave their local leagues?</h4>
            <p>The teams say they will continue in the local leagues. However,
            their federations say this will not be possible.</p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 18px;">What is the biggest motivation of the 12 clubs?</h4>
            <p>Futbol otoriteleri, böylesi bir planın arkasında yatan en
            büyük motivasyonun para olduğunu düşünüyor.</p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 18px;">How did the European Super League debate begin?</h4>
            <p>The quality of tournaments available in Europe has been a matter of debate for 
            some time. In October 2020, meetings were held on a new 4.6 billion euro league,
            including the American investment bank JP Morgan, that will replace the Champions League.             
            UEFA hoped that the structural change in the Champions League, which was extended to 36
            teams, would shelve the European Super League plans. With the change, starting from the
            2024/25 season, each team will play at least 10 matches in five of them. The first 8
            teams will go round. 9-24. The ranked teams will play in a double-match elimination
            method to stay in the last 16 rounds. However, 12 clubs, which announced that they
            established the European Super League, say that the reforms are not enough.         
            In their statement, they said, "In the past months, there have been very inclusive
            discussions with the parties on the future of the European trophies. The founding
            clubs are of the opinion that the proposed solutions will not solve the basic problems."</p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 18px;">How will the matches be played?</h4>
            <p>With the addition of 3 more clubs to the founding teams, the matches will be played
            between 20 clubs, 15 of which are founding clubs, on weekdays. The remaining 5
            clubs will be chosen differently each year. The teams will be divided into two groups of
            10. At the end of 18 matches, 6 teams that finish the groups in the top three will
            directly advance to the quarter-finals. The fourths and fifths of the two groups will
            also play a two-legged play-off. Quarter and semi-final matches will be played over a
            double match, and the final will be played over a single match.</p>
