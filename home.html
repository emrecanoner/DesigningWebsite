            <h3 class="main">NASA has flown its helicopter named Ingenuity for the first time on the Red Planet</h3>
            <p class="panel">
                This was the first controlled flight of a powered aircraft on another planet. According to
                preliminary data reaching NASA from Mars,
                the Ingenuity was in the air for less than a minute.
                This was the aim of the scientists. NASA aims to gradually increase the flight time
                and altitude of the helicopter in the coming days.
                The flight was originally scheduled for April 11, but was delayed due to a software error.
                The drone, which weighed about 1.8 kilograms, took off at 10:30 BST. It took a few hours
                for the data to reach the world.</p>
                <hr>
            <p class="panel">NASA warned that "the flight may not be successful". But scientists' worries did not come true.
                In the first flight attempt, the helicopter was planned to rise three meters from the ground
                and land after 30 seconds of flight. After analyzing the incoming data, NASA will also
                explain whether this plan is fully realized.
                Ingenuity was transported to Mars by Perseverance,
                the spacecraft that landed in Jezero Crater on February 18.
                The primary purpose of flight is to show that this technology can work on another planet.
                In reference to American aviators Orville and Wilbur Wright, who flew the first powered aircraft
                in 1903, NASA stated that the flight of the twin-engine helicopter would be
                "a Wright Brothers moment".

                12 big clubs in Europe announced that they established the European Super League,

                Aleksander Ceferin said, "Players who will play in the European Super League

            <p class="panel">
                Mozart week 2021 is now underway. The opening concert was performed by
                Artistic Director, Rolando Villazón, as he took to the stage with the
                Salzburg Mozarteum Orchestra under the baton of Kery-Lynn Wilson.
                But the tribute to Mozart this year is marked by an extra special event:
                the world premiere of a previously unknown piece by the musical prodigy himself.
                The newly discovered piano solo, entitled Allegro in D - K.626b/16, was played
                by the world-famous pianist, Seong-Jin Cho in the Great Hall of the Salzburg
                Mozarteum Foundation. The 94-second recital took place on the 27th of January,
                an iconic date that marked the 265th anniversary of the composer's birthday.</p>
